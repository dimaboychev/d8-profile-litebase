WHAT IS THIS?
-------------

Litebase is an installation profile for Drupal 8. See "Installation Profiles"
below for more info.
Litebase is an opinionated Drupal profile (minimal variant) meant as a
base point for projects. Configurations are set for development environment
to get you up and running as fast as possible.
It comes with a light theme for hardcore themers that like their html clean
and starting from scratch (AKA base theme = false, which in turn sets it
to the "Stable" theme)


INSTALLATION PROFILES
---------------------

Installation profiles define additional steps (such as enabling modules,
defining content types, etc.) that run after the base installation provided
by core when Drupal is first installed. There are two basic installation
profiles provided with Drupal core.

Installation profiles from the Drupal community modify the installation process
to provide a website for a specific use case, such as a CMS for media
publishers, a web-based project tracking tool, or a full-fledged CRM for
non-profit organizations raising money and accepting donations. They can be
distributed as bare installation profiles or as "distributions". Distributions
include Drupal core, the installation profile, and all other required
extensions, such as contributed and custom modules, themes, and third-party
libraries. Bare installation profiles require you to download Drupal Core and
the required extensions separately; place the downloaded profile in the
/profiles directory before you start the installation process.
